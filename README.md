# Menlo School Robotics Team 94027A (Joe's Skambreakers)
This is our autonomous code for the 2022-23 season. We have competed in four competitions this year (Central Valley Spin Up #2, Tri-Valley Tournament #1, NorCal Silicon Valley Signature Event, and the Region 2 State Championships. <br/>

Our [skills code](https://github.com/Menlo-Robotics-94027A/22-23-Autonomous/tree/main/Skills) can spin all four rollers, shoot three sets of three discs, and expand to cover roughly 8 tiles. Our [match autonomous](https://github.com/Menlo-Robotics-94027A/22-23-Autonomous/tree/main/Match) spins one roller and shoots 3-6 discs into the high goal. Our [driver code](https://github.com/Menlo-Robotics-94027A/22-23-Autonomous/tree/main/Match) sets different shooting speeds for various proximities and controls the pneumatic expansion and shooter intake.<br/>
Autonomous has been challenging this year because we have not had access to sensors or a gps-tracker compatible field; however, despite this added challenge we are proud of the complexity and accuracy of our programs. next year we hope to get sensors and a new field to improve on our autonomous and score more points. We are also planning on transitioning to using python on VScode.
